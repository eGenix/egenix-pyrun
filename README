eGenix PyRun
============

PyRun currently supports three Python releases:

 * Python 2.6
 * Python 2.7
 * Python 3.4

For each release, only one patch level version is supported,
since PyRun has to patch to the Python source code in order to
implement extensions needed to make PyRun more compatible with
standard Python.

Please see the top of the Makefile for the patch level releases
supported by this release of eGenix PyRun.

Build Dependencies
------------------

The following development packages need to be installed on the
build system in addition to the compiler suite:

 * libbz2-devel
 * sqlite3-devel
 * openssl-devel
 * zlib-devel

The tests need a few extra libs:

 * libxml2-devel
 * libxslt-devel

Building
--------

"make build-all" will build eGenix PyRun for all supported Python
releases and place the results into the build-* directories.

If you want to create distribution files instead, use
"make all-distributions".

For building just one Python release target, you have to specify
the PYTHONFULLVERSION on the make command line:

make build PYTHONFULLVERSION=2.7.10

or

make distribution PYTHONFULLVERSION=2.7.10

Testing
-------

The Makefile has various test targets.

"make test-basic" will test the basic functionality of eGenix PyRun.

"make test-pip" can be used to test eGenix PyRun against various
packages downloaded using pip.

"make test-distribution" runs both test-basic and test-pip.

"make test-all-distributions" will run test-distribution for all
supported Python releases.

"make test-all-pyruns" will run test-basic for all supported Python
releases.

"make test-ssl" tests the PYRUN_HTTPSVERIFY env var.
